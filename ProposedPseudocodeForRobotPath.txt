//When am I adding to the move... before it gets sent in or after?  I think it needs to be berore

bool genMoves(pair<int, int> currRobPos, pair<int, int> destination, deque <pair<int, int>> moves, Direction currDirection, stack<Direction> savedDirections){

    if(currRobPos == destination){
        return true;
    }

    else if(occupied(currRobPos) || currRobPos Outside Of Bounds){
        return false;
    }

    else if (!return genMoves((currRobPos + 1 in "Direction"), destination, moves, savedDirections){

        // Undo move
        moves.pop_back();

        //change Direction
        currDirection = direction to the left

        //add previous direction to the stack
        savedDirectionMoves.push();

        return genMoves()

    }
    else{

        return genMoves

    }


}

can also try duplicating direction to the left as direction to the right, and see if that improves behavior
